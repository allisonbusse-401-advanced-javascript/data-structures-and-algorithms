# Trees
This challenges asks us to write two classes for Binary Trees and Binary Search Trees and several methods for each.   

## Challenge
For Binary Trees, write functions to traverse the tree in preorder, inorder, and postorder.

For Binary Search Trees, write functions to add a value to the tree in the right spot and find if a tree contains a certain value. 

## Approach & Efficiency
I mostly used recursive helper functions to use for these methods since we need to loop through multiple levels of each tree and we don't know how deep they are.
