# Tree Intersection
This challenges asks us to find the overlapping values in two tress. 

## Challenge
Write a function that takes in trees and returns the values that appear in both trees. 

## Approach & Efficiency
I used my binary tree class and one of the traversal methods I wrote to create the trees and return the values from both of them. Then I did a for loop to see where the values overlapped.
