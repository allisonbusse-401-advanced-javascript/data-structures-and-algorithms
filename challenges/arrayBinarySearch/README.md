# Binary Search an Array
This is a simple function written using JavaScript.

## Challenge
This challenge required taking in an array and a value and using binary search to find the value in the array and return its index. If the value is not found, return -1. 

## Approach & Efficiency
I used a logarithmic approach to find the middle index of the array and see if the value was higher or lower than that, and only search through half the array at a time to find it. If it's not found in the while loop, I just return -1 at the end of the function.
