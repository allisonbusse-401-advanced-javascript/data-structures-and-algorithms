# Reverse an Array
This is a simple function written using JavaScript.

## Challenge
This challenge required taking in an array and reversing the order of the elements within it without using any built-in JavaScript methods for arrays. 

## Approach & Efficiency
I decided to loop through the array backwards and push each element into a new array in that order, therefore reversing the order of the original array.
