# Shift an Array
This is a simple function written using JavaScript.

## Challenge
This challenge required taking in an array and a value and inserting the value into the middle position of the array. 

## Approach & Efficiency
I created a new array and added the first half of the original array to that, then I found the middle point of that array and added the given value at that index. I shifted the latter half of the original array back one index to accommodate the new value.
